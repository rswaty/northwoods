    "text": "Summary\nHistorically the Northwoods experienced, on average, ~1.2M acres of fire annually. These fires were largely ignited as part of Indigenous land management practices (see Stewart, 2002). Areas with relatively short historical MFRIs were spread across the region with several areas standing out including:\n\ncentral Minnesota\nnortheastern and northwestern Wisconsin\nlarge sections of the northern half of the lower peninsula of MI\n\nWhile these large areas stand out, there are historically fire adapted ecosystems peppered across much of the region. Notably, some of the fire-adapted ecosystems were surrounded by ecosystems with typically long MFRIs, such as northern hardwoods limiting spread. Further, most of the ecosystems with short MFRI were dominated by surface fires that would have killed less than 25% of the vegetation.\n\n\n\nMost historical fires occurred in pine, oak and peatland dominated ecosystems, especially the barrens types."

    "text": "INCOMPLETE DRAFT FOR INTERNAL CONSUMPTION ONLY\n\nWhy this why now: Evaluating the potential for transformational changes in ecosystem condition and wildfire risk for the Northwoods region\nWildfires, drought, ice and windstorm events, and other natural disturbances are foundational processes that shape the condition of ecosystems, and the services they provide to people. Anthropogenic drivers like introduced pests and pathogens, groundwater depletion, and fire suppression can disrupt natural processes, and reduce the resilience of forest ecosystems to disturbances.\n\n\n\nNorthwods Fire Assessment Boundary. Compiled by Randy Swaty from Bailey’s Ecoregions (Bailey, 2016. https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2016-0003)\n\n\nFurther, we expect that climate change, especially temperature-related increases in evaporative demand (a key indicator of water loss rates from soils and vegetation), has the potential to rapidly amplify the effects of anthropogenic stressors, promoting drought stress in forest vegetation, and transformational increases in fire risk.\nWhile these risks to forests of the Northwoods Region are pervasive and associated with many uncertainties, understanding the spatial patterns of past disturbances, current vegetation conditions, management and water use history, and site conditions can help us compare relative risks for catastrophic fires."
