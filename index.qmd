### Why this why now: Evaluating the potential for transformational changes in ecosystem condition and wildfire risk for the Northwoods region

Wildfires, drought, ice and windstorm events, and other natural disturbances are foundational processes that shape the condition of ecosystems, and the services they provide to people.  Anthropogenic drivers like introduced pests and pathogens, groundwater depletion, and fire suppression can disrupt natural processes, and reduce the resilience of forest ecosystems to disturbances.

Further, we expect that climate change, especially temperature-related increases in evaporative demand (a key indicator of water loss rates from soils and vegetation), has the potential to rapidly amplify the effects of anthropogenic stressors, promoting drought stress in forest vegetation, and transformational increases in fire risk.  


While these risks to forests of the Northwoods Region are pervasive and associated with many uncertainties, understanding the spatial patterns of past disturbances, current vegetation conditions, management and water use history, and site conditions can help us compare relative risks for catastrophic fires.
